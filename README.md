Generates a dataset for 500 customers with financial attributes.

Creates financial features like Debt-to-Income Ratio.

Applies loan offer calculation logic:
High credit score, no defaults → Higher loan offer.
Medium credit score, few defaults → Moderate loan offer.
Low credit score, multiple defaults → No offer.

Segments customers into categories (Premium, Standard, Basic, Not Eligible).
